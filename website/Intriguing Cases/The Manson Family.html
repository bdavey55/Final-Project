          <h1>The Manson Family</h1>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Charles Manson is considered to be one of the most disturbed, ruthless and clincally-insane men on the planet, again depending who you ask (he recently was just married while serving his life sentence in prison to a devout fan outside). This story is so complex and intriguing that it is hard to even know where to start. Basically, this man, a failing musician in California who had close ties to members of the worldwide superstars <em>The Eagles</em>, gained a small devout following and called them his family. They lived on a ranch for some time, committing countless acts of terror and violence, some proven others discarded, on the local California community. The famous case is the <a href="http://www.findadeath.com/Deceased/t/tate/tate_murders.htm">Tate murders</a>, which can be further explained in the link. </p>
          <p>But it wasn't the sheer violence that Manson carried out that made him and his family so famous. It was the reasoning and logic behind it; they felt no remorse and openly admitted to the crimes because it was what Manson wanted, who was believed to be their savior or a messiah figure. The photo below shows a handful of his close family members in an infamous shot in a cave that they spent many nights planning and discussing the group's beliefs and responsibilities. </p>
