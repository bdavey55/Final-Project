          <h1>What Defines a Cult?</h1>
          <p>The word &quot;cult&quot; has a long and ambiguous history, with numerous definitions and ideas relating to it. It is almost near impossible to pinpoint an exact, universal definition of the word, because all of these different organizational groups have different beliefs of what it is they actually stand for, and how we perceive them. The definition according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult">Wikipedia</a> reads: </p>
          <p>&quot;In the sociological classifications of religious movements, a <strong>cult</strong> is a religious or other social group with socially deviant and novel beliefs and practices. However, whether any particular group's beliefs and practices are sufficiently deviant or novel is often unclear, and thus establishing a precise definition based on these criteria is problematic. The English word often carries derogatory connotations.</p>
          <p>The word &quot;cult&quot; has been controversial. One reason is that it (as used in the pejorative sense) is considered a subjective term, used as an <em>ad hominem</em> attack against groups with simply differing doctrines or practices, and without a clear or consistent definition. It has also been used selectively by proponents of mind control theory.</p>
          <p>Beginning in the 1930s cults became the object of sociological study in the context of the study of religious behavior. Certain groups have been labeled as cults and opposed by the Christian countercult movement for their unorthodox beliefs; and since the 1970s by the secular anti-cult movement, partly motivated in reaction to acts of violence committed by members of some groups. Some of the anti-cult claims have been disputed by other scholars, leading to further controversies.&quot;</p>
