          <h1>Characteristics</h1>
          <p>Though there is not a definitive universal definition for the word &quot;cult,&quot; there are numerous characteristics that can help narrow down whether or not the selected group is in fact a cult or not. Some of these include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Organized group of individuals</li>
            <li>Individuals practicing and exerting the same beliefs or ideas</li>
            <li>The degree of practice can sometimes reach extreme measures</li>
            <li>The individuals in the group display a high sense of devotion and/or submission</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Those characteristics are a paraphrased, watered-down list of what most people, and most sites and media outlets, believe a cult to be. The following list was pulled from the online resource <em><a href="http://carm.org/signs-practices-of-a-cult">Christian Apologetics &amp; Research Ministry</a></em>: </p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Submission</strong>: 
              <ol>
                <li>Complete, almost unquestioned trust in the leadership. </li>
                <li>Leaders are often seen as prophets, apostles, or special individuals with unusual connections to God. This helps a person give themselves over psychologically to trusting someone else for their spiritual welfare.</li>
                <li>Increased submission to the leadership is rewarded with additional responsibilities and/or roles, and/or praises, increasing the importance of the person within the group.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Exclusivity</strong>
              <ol>
                <li>Their group is the only true religious system, or one of the few true remnants of God's people.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Persecution</strong> <strong>complex</strong>
              <ol>
                <li>Us against them mentality. Therefore, when someone (inside or outside of the group) corrects the group in doctrine and/or behavior, it is interpreted as persecution, which then is interpreted as validation.  </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Control</strong>
              <ol>
                <li>Control of members' actions and thinking through repeated indoctrination and/or threats of loss of salvation, or a place to live, or receiving curses from God, etc.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Isolation</strong>
              <ol>
                <li>Minimizing contact of church members with those outside the group. This facilitates a further control over the thinking and practices of the members by the leadership.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Love Bombing</strong>
              <ol>
                <li>Showing great attention and love to a person in the group by others in the group, to help transfer emotional dependence to the group.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Special Knowledge</strong>
              <ol>
                <li>Instructions and/or knowledge are sometimes said to be received by a leader(s) from God. This leader then informs the members.</li>
                <li>The Special Knowledge can be received through visions, dreams, or new interpretations of sacred scriptures such as the Bible.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Indoctrination</strong>
              <ol>
                <li>The teachings of the group are repeatedly drilled into the members, but the indoctrination usually occurs around Special Knowledge.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Salvation</strong>
              <ol>
                <li>Salvation from the judgment of God is maintained through association and/or submission with the group, its authority, and/or its Special Knowledge.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Group Think</strong>
              <ol>
                <li>The group's coherence is maintained by the observance to policies handed down from those in authority.</li>
                <li>There is an internal enforcement of policies by members who reward &quot;proper&quot; behavior, and those who perform properly are rewarded with further inclusion and acceptance by the group.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Cognitive Dissonance</strong>
              <ol>
                <li>Avoidance of critical thinking and/or maintaining logically impossible beliefs and/or beliefs that are inconsistent with other beliefs held by the group.</li>
                <li>Avoidance of and/or denial of any facts that might contradict the group's belief system.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Shunning</strong>
              <ol>
                <li>Those who do not keep in step with group policies are shunned and/or expelled.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Gender Roles</strong>
              <ol>
                <li>Control of gender roles and definitions.</li>
                <li>Severe control of gender roles sometimes leads to sexual exploitation.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Appearance Standards</strong>
              <ol>
                <li>Often a common appearance is required and maintained. For instance, women might wear prairie dresses, and/or their hair in buns, and/or no makeup, and/or the men might all wear white short-sleeved shirts, and/or without beards, or all wear beards.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
