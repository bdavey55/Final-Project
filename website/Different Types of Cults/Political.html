          <h1>Political Cults</h1>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
          <p>Political cults are extremely prominent in the U.S., depending on who you ask. For instance, the Republican or Democratic or any political party or group for that matter could be considered a cult, based on some of the characteristics. These cults are dangerous because of the actual power they have, not simply confined to their small group or party. For example whoever is in the White House calls all of the shots; the President and his party may be involved in some type of cult or considerd to be one, some conspiracy theorists explain. Here is what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult#Political_cults">Wikipedia</a> has to say on the matter: </p>
          <p>&quot;A political cult is a cult with a primary interest in political action and ideology. Groups that some writers have termed as &quot;political cults,&quot; mostly advocating far-left or far-right agendas, have received some attention from journalists and scholars. In their 2000 book <em>On the Edge: Political Cults Right and Left</em>, Dennis Tourish and Tim Wohlforth discuss about a dozen organizations in the United States and Great Britain that they characterize as cults. In a separate article Tourish says that in his usage:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The word cult is not a term of abuse, as this paper tries to explain. It is nothing more than a shorthand expression for a particular set of practices that have been observed in a variety of dysfunctional organisations.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>The LaRouche Movement[90] and Gino Parente's National Labor Federation (NATLFED) are examples of political groups that have been described as &quot;cults&quot;, based in the United States; another is Marlene Dixon's now-defunctDemocratic Workers Party (a critical history of the DWP is given in <em>Bounded Choice</em> by Janja A. Lalich, a sociologist and former DWP member).</p>
          <p>The followers of Ayn Rand were characterized as a &quot;cult&quot; by economist Murray N. Rothbard during her lifetime, and later by Michael Shermer. The core group around Rand was called the &quot;Collective&quot; and is now defunct (the chief group disseminating Rand's ideas today is the Ayn Rand Institute). Although the Collective advocated an individualist philosophy, Rothbard claimed they were organized in the manner of a &quot;Leninist&quot; organization.</p>
          <p>In Britain, the Workers Revolutionary Party, a Trotskyist group led by the late Gerry Healy and strongly supported by actress Vanessa Redgrave, has been described by others, who have been involved in the Trotskyist movement, as having been a cult or as displaying cult-like characteristics in the 1970s and 1980s. It is also described as such by Tourish and Wohlforth in their writings. In his review of Tourish and Wohlforth's book, Bob Pitt, a former member of the WRP concedes that it had a &quot;cult-like character&quot; but argues that rather than being typical of the far left, this feature actually made the WRP atypical and &quot;led to its being treated as a pariah within the revolutionary left itself.&quot; Workers' Struggle (LO, <em>Lutte ouvrière</em>) in France, publicly headed by Arlette Laguiller but revealed in the 1990s to be directed by Robert Barcia, has often been criticized as a cult, for example by Daniel Cohn-Bendit and his older brother Gabriel Cohn-Bendit, as well as <em>L'Humanité</em> and <em>Libération</em>.</p>
          <p>In his book <em>Les Sectes Politiques: 1965–1995</em> (translation: <em>Political cults: 1965–1995</em>), French writer Cyril Le Tallec considered some religious groups as cults involved in politics, including the League for Catholic Counter-Reformation, the Cultural Office of Cluny, New Acropolis, Sōka Gakkai, the Divine Light Mission, Tradition Family Property (TFP), Longo-Mai, the Supermen Club and the Association for Promotion of the Industrial Arts (Solazaref).&quot;</p>
