          <h1>Religious Cults</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>	Religious cults are the generic, publically-thought image of what cults are. They are usually perceived as creepy, hooded people in robes standing around a circle singing some hymn sacrificing something or someone to a distinct diety, according to television and movies. Religious cults are the more-prominent category of cults in the U.S., simply because they are out in the open for the most part. Most famous cult cases, and disasters for that matter, arose from a religious group or cult. These religious movements can be, as seen throughout history, violent and non-violent. The fact that relgion is so overwhelmingly powerful to some individuals makes this type of cult the scariest, in my opinion. It is however extremely dangerous regardless, for people will go through drastic measures to ensure their faith and salvation alongside others. The promise of an afterlife or overall good standing in their own lives is what drives religion, and religious groups in general, which means these individuals have &quot;nothing to lose&quot; when it comes to devoting their faith, time, energy, mind, and even bodies to their distinct group or practice. The idea of giving yourself up to and for others is the underlying message in religious cults, which again if things do turn violent or drastic, could become very dangerous. </p>
